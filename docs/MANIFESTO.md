# Creative Manifesto – Particles Lab

This laboratory exists to explore how particles can tell visual stories.

The goal is not to optimize for optimization’s sake, but to understand how motion can generate emotion. Shaders as brushes. WebGL as canvas. R3F as the instrument to compose.

Principles

- Show, don’t tell.
  Each experiment ships as a POC and a real‑time demo.
- Explore, fail, learn.
  A broken prototype teaches more than a perfect idea in your head.
- Technology with intention.
  No animation exists “just because”; every visual decision aims to spark curiosity.
- The viewer matters.
  If someone feels fascination, calm, or surprise, the goal is met.
- Code is also craft.
  WebGL and GLSL are not only engineering—they are expressive tools.

This lab is a space to experiment without fear: to create, break, delete, try again—and share the process.
