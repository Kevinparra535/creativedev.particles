// Spring physics for natural motion
const { position } = useSpring({ 
  to: { position: targetPosition },
  config: { tension: 120, friction: 14 }
})
```

### **Memory-Efficient Patterns**
```typescript
// Object pooling for zero-garbage collection
const particlePool = new ObjectPool(() => new Particle(), 1000)
```
